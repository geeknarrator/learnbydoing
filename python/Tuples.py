# Similar to list but once a tuple is created, you cannot add, delete , replace, reorder the items
# uses () to create a tuple
first_tuple= () # empty tuple
tuple = (1,2,3)
tuple1 = (tuple)
print(tuple1)

# len() sum(), min(), max() works similarly on tuples as list

# for loop works similarly on tuples
# slicing works similarly on tuples
